## Angel 2.0 Documentation and Guides
This is the updated documentation site for the
[Angel](https://angel-dart.github.io) framework. More
emphasis was placed on providing complete guides, rather
than just summary/documentation pages. Ideally, by the time
you've read just a few of the pages, you'll already be well on
your way to Angel mastery.

## What is Angel?
Simply put, Angel is a framework for writing full-stack Dart
apps. The goal of Angel, and its surrounding tooling, is
to allow developers and teams to build their entire stack
around the Dart ecosystem.

## Why Angel?
1. It has a low learning curve, especially for those with
past experience building Web servers.
2. It comes with an ecosystem of packages providing support
for WebSockets, file serving, authentication, security,
and more.
3. It has a codegen-based ORM for PostgreSQL, and also
supports other databases easily.
4. It ships with fast, reliable testing infrastructure,
preventing any unwelcome surprises in production.
5. It ships with dedicated client libraries for Flutter,
the Web, and the VM, allowing you to share a lot of logic
between front ends.
6. Everything is designed with portability in mind, so you
can share significant amounts of code, and ship faster.
7. The Angel CLI includes deployment helpers, so even if
you're working alone, you can get your app to market.
8. Dedicated GraphQL support, which is completely compatible
with existing GraphQL clients and tooling.
9. Much more...

## How can I contribute?
Once version 2.0 lands, and becomes stable, it will be
much easier to outline goals, and less daunting for new
contributors to send pull requests.
